# Creating a Docker Swarm


## Create Master VM 

createvm Gworewia (master)
..
Domain Gworewia started

ssh Stevedore@Gworewia

    ## Initialize Swarm with VM's address

    docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.201.15

        ....
	Swarm initialized: current node (tkhj2d3z40x51vodr1a2b4n2h) is now a manager.

	To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

	    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-66w8t157ufren0nv8kvdvh912va3y7wpzw6t7nbiz5xjt5vxbe-cvc3tg9bktu1likj06btd69x6 192.168.201.15:2377

	To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
        ....
